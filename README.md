## App description

Our app is designed to help people who are not residents of China learn about healthy and balanced Chinese food collocation and recipes, and allow users to learn more about Chinese food culture while doing it themselves. It will recommend Chinese recipes according to the customer's needs or according to the customer's own physical condition and food preferences, and will ensure that each recipe is nutritionally balanced and healthy. It can also do calorie counting, helping users to calculate their daily calorie intake well. Not only that, but the app also helps customers choose food while teaching users how to cook it and teaching traditional Chinese food culture in the process.
